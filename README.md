Neural Network Visualiser Web App
=================================

This is a simple web application using Streamlit and a model server using Keras and Flask.

Used Keras to train a neural network model on MNIST dataset.

Used Keras's functional API to create a model with multiple outputs.

This web application visualises the outputs of all nodes of all layers of Neural Network for a given input image.

After running locally deployed the client and server to Heroku.
